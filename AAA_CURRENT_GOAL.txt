- Get button to a state where you can place it and push it to send a message to the console, as well as responding to the push
	+ All basic functionality including placing and sending message on push
	- Visual responses to state changes
		- Get gui styles system up and runnin innit
			+ need resource manager
			- Switch changeState functionality over to guiObject class - it's too general to just be in button!

	ADVICE FOR INCLUDES AND HEADER DECLARATIONS
- do nothing if: A makes no references at all to B
- do nothing if: The only reference to B is in a friend declaration
- forward declare B if: A contains a B pointer or reference: B* myb;
- forward declare B if: one or more functions has a B object/pointer/reference as a parementer, or as a return type: B MyFunction(B myb);
- #include "b.h" if: B is a parent class of A
- #include "b.h" if: A contains a B object: B myb;
